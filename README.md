Patrick Steil (100% of the added coding), Mariette Vasen

## Installing
Run `cargo build --release`, which builds the main executable in `target/release`.

## Usage
Use `findminhs solve <hypergraph-file.hgr> <settings-file>`. A `settings.json` file is already in the repo.

## Instances
Under `test_hs/` you can find a selection of `*.hgr` files, which we used to benchmark our algorithm.
